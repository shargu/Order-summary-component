## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### Useful resources

- [A modern css reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - TThis helped me for a few reasons. First, it clarified why a custom CSS reset is important, not just how to implement one. I really liked the pattern Josh used—it's clean, modern, and avoids the pitfalls of older resets. The explanation behind each line also helped me understand the intent, not just the code. I’ll definitely be using this approach in future projects!
